# CMOS-R2R-DAC-OpAmp-Integration
Transistor-level design and simulation of a 4-bit R-2R ladder DAC integrated with a two-stage CMOS operational amplifier using Cadence Virtuoso (90 nm gpdk). Includes op-amp performance analysis-AC gain vs phase, transient, PSRR, slew rate, power analysis and DAC transient staircase output verification.
